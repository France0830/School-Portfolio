Introduction
Class Pulse is an intuitive digital tool developed to track and visualize student engagement in online learning environments.
Its primary goal is to assist teachers in identifying participation patterns and students in becoming more self-aware of their learning habits. 
The system uses data such as login frequency, time spent on materials, quiz activity, discussion participation, and assignment submissions to generate actionable insights.
This manual provides instructions for interacting with the prototype version of Class Pulse, developed using Figma, a widely used UI/UX design and prototyping platform.
A. Accessing the Prototype
Visit the prototype link shared via email or class website.

Open the link using a web browser (preferably Chrome, Edge, or Safari).

Log in to your Figma account if required (view-only mode usually available for public prototypes).

B. Navigating the Interface
Once opened, you will see a mockup of a mobile screen. Use arrow keys or your mouse to move between frames (screens).

Key Screens in the Prototype:
Login Page: Where users enter credentials (non-functional in prototype).

Dashboard: Displays summary of engagement statistics.

Engagement Analyzer: Interactive graphs and visual data of student activity.

Class Overview: Shows all enrolled students and their engagement levels.

Student Profile: Detailed breakdown per student.

Settings: Manage notifications, themes, language, and data export options.

C. Interacting with the Prototype
Click navigation icons at the bottom or top of screens to move between pages.

On graphs or cards, hover or click to simulate viewing expanded data (based on the prototype setup).

Try tapping on menu items to switch views and simulate real app behavior.
Key Features Available in the Prototype
Feature	Description
Engagement Graphs	Shows time spent, logins, and participation per day/week
Participation Summary	Highlights discussions, quizzes, and assignments
Student Reports	Individual profile with engagement logs and alerts
Color Indicators	Green (Active), Yellow (At Risk), Red (Inactive)
Mock Notification Alerts	Shows samples of how inactivity alerts might appear to students or teachers

Prototype Limitations
No real data or user accounts—this is a design prototype, not a working app.

Buttons and inputs are mostly static—used for simulation only.

Some transitions may be incomplete if not linked in the Figma flow.
Use Case Scenarios
Teachers: Log in to the dashboard to check class-wide activity; use filters to view individual students who need assistance.

Students: View personal engagement dashboard to see how they’re doing and get tips to stay on track.

Admin Users (future version): Export class data or integrate with LMS for wider school monitoring.

Feedback and Improvements
We encourage testers and users to provide feedback based on:

Ease of navigation

Clarity of visualizations

Accessibility and mobile-friendliness

Suggestions for new features

All feedback will be considered in the next prototype or development phase.
